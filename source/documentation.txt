===============================================
Documentation is the Most Valuable Thing You Do
===============================================

Writing or maintaining documentation is probably the most important
things that systems administrators *can do*. As a technical writer my
perspective may be a bit skewed. While :doc:`contents` does not
address technical writing in any substantial manner, documentation is
incredibly important to the work of systems administrators.

It's feasible that systems administrators consume documentation as a
class than any other class of users. Furthermore, given
administrator's distance from the development process and their role
as "professional users" of software, systems administrators have the
potential to generate very good technical writers. This section
provides an overview of how technical writing and documentation works,
and how to write high quality documentation as needed.

The Challenge of Documentation
------------------------------

Good documentation is both technically complex and simple to read and
understand: it both has good logical at all levels of organization and
works well for reader who won't read more than a few paragraphs. While
documentation presents complex ideas and documentation resources
themselves are reasonably complex works, they must: 

- thoroughly describe how a tool or product operates (i.e. what all of
  the knobs do,)

- how to use the product (i.e. tutorials, installation and
  configuration guides,) and

- describe possible use and configuration (i.e. use cases, practical
  guides, case studies.)

Often these goals and requirements conflict with each other, and
present substantial challenges to maintaining quality well organized
resources.

Providing documentation that focuses on and addresses the diversity of
user experience is quite difficult. If you write documentation and
you're not keenly aware of your audience, stop and assess what you're
writing and how you're approaching your task. If you're re-reading
documentation and you find it difficult to "figure out," stop and work
to understand the question you're asking and what kind of user you are
relative to the intended audience.

A poor sense of audience and disorganized goals are often the
prevailing issue with technical manuals and resources, but there are
other potential problems that documentation processes face.

- Developers shouldn't write documentation.

  Having the developer responsible for the code also responsible for
  documenting its use often leads to poor documentation. Developers
  are, rightfully, very interested in *how* the technology works and
  how the internals affect the operation. In many cases, however, when
  users need to know details about the internal operation of a piece
  of technology, *there is a larger problem*: either the tool isn't
  functioning properly, the use case falls outside of the design of
  the product, or there is a larger design flaw. More than that even,
  developers often work on very narrow sections of products and have a
  hard time figuring how users actually interact with their features.

  Less abstractly, however, it's a project management problem:
  documentation is a substantial task and if developers are writing
  documentation then they're not writing code. While documentation
  absolutely essential, dedicating an engineer to writing
  documentation is often a difficult management decision, which means
  documentation ends up woefully under-prioritized.

- Documentation is difficult to maintain, and must be continually
  updated.

  No documentation is perfect, just as its inevitable that some bugs
  slip into code or glitches into operational deployments, there are
  errors and glitches in documentation. Not only does software
  continue to develop and change, but the interaction of a host of
  third party tools means that user experiences can change
  independently of the subject matter itself.

  Once the documentation is complete, keeping it up to date, and
  making sure that it continues to address the current needs of users
  (current examples, continues to address the most common support
  issues,) represents a significant challenge. Not only do development
  teams and organizations need to dedicate time and resources to
  maintaining documentation, but it's crucial (particularly on larger
  more distributed teams) that information flows into the
  documentation from changes to the product itself, to feedback from
  support, and notes quality assurance teams, and from the users
  themselves.

- There are no shortcuts to good documentation.

  Engineers are often interested in finding ways 
  to automate some aspect of their documentation
  responsibility. Generate documentation from the comments of their
  unit tests, or the documentation strings in their functions. Because
  documentation address the disconnect between users and code, it's
  difficult or impossible to write code that will obviate writing
  documentation.

  There is a lot of room for automation in documentation:
  for the most part the methods for publishing and updating
  documentation are terrible, which makes keeping
  documentation up to date even more bothersome. It's also much easier
  to maintain reference material and make sure that software hasn't
  changed if the products you're documenting can output all error
  codes, or provide a complete listing of commands, which make some of
  the more tedious problems of documentation less difficult. 

  For instance, it might be nice to have code that produces listings
  of error codes, options, and APIs to make it trivial to ensure that
  the software hasn't changed. Having said that, this kind of
  automation and testing really only covers a small percentage of
  cases.

Good documentation makes software and tools more valuable and more
durable, and although documentation can be a great expense, in the
long term its almost always worthwhile.

Qualities of Superior Documentation
-----------------------------------

Documentation must be singular. While documentation serves different
audiences and has different goals, it's important that there be only
one source of information to avoid fragmenting and potentially
confusing users and readers. In pursuit of singluar, high quality
documentation that provides values to readers, writers must construct
documentation that is: well organized and effectively indexed

The previous section addressed some of the common shortcomings of
documentation, while this section address some of the mechanical or
practical things that makes "okay" or merely "good" documentation
great.

.. index:: documentation; organization

Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most of the time users only consult documentation after they're
already using the tool or process, and then only if they have a
problem. Technical writers--hopefully--should strive to write
documentation that anticipates this use. At the same time its
important to write documentation that addresses other key uses cases:
beginner's getting started guides, reference material, etc. 

Documentation may have unique usage patterns and audience profiles,
depending on the specific content but fundamentally, documentation is
no different from any other kind of informational resource. If you're
used to organizing code, or server racks, or supply closets, or even
your file system, and you have methods that already work, the chances
are these organizational skills will be transferable.

The titles, section heading, and overall presentation of the
documentation should make it clear where all the information is within
the document.  If a the answer of a question, or a particular section
seems like it could go in multiple locations, then this might indicate
a bug in the organization of the documentation. Having the same piece
of information in multiple locations makes the resource harder to
maintain, and leads to situations where users find the right answer in
the wrong context for the problem they're trying to solve, which is
sub-optimal. Treat these kinds of problems as "bugs" with overall
organization or the scope of the current resource.

Most documentation systems have support for easy cross-referencing and
linking that makes it easy to achieve this "singularity of
information," but making sure that everything is properly referenced
and internally linked can be difficult.

Many writers and developers have opinions about the best way to
organize documentation. Taking feedback is important, but its hard to
integrate all feedback: particularly when feedback reflects specific
and uncommon user experiences. In general well organized documentation
has the following characteristics: 

1. Hierarchy is good and adds clarity, but too much hierarchy creates
   confusion.

   You get two, maybe three, levels of hierarchy in any (textual)
   system before it gets needlessly complex and difficult to
   manage. While additional hierarchy makes it easy to have more
   granular organization, it also increases the chance that pieces of
   information will become buried in trees that users may never
   discover. 

   Writers tend to approach documentation "from the bottom up," when
   writing but users almost always approach it from the "top down."
   This difference isn't bad, and it can lead to very thorough
   documentation, but it means that users can perceive gaps that don't
   *really* exist. Having less hierarchy minimizes these problems and
   makes the documentation easier to maintain.

2. Short, clear inductive paragraphs are (*almost*) always best.

   Perhaps the hardest aspect of technical writing for people with a
   writing background, is that you have to write documentation in a
   way that makes it easy to *not* read. Like journalistic writing,
   but unlike every other kind of writing, technical documents must be
   inductive: present conclusions and state purposes at the very
   beginning of the resource, chapters, section, and even paragraphs,
   and *then* delve into details and explanations.

   This is very counter-intuitive for many writers, and even for
   technical people who deal with users, [#public-engineering]_ but
   inductive documentation is easy to read (or not read,) provides the
   answers that users actually need.

.. [#public-engineering] Developers, support people, integration
   folks, and sales engineering types often provide examples as a way
   of explanation, or want documentation to include too much
   introduction. The folks who do this kind of work interact must
   often explain complex topics deductively and the inductive approach
   doesn't mesh with the way they must conceptualize technical
   information.

Search and Indexing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most of the time, the answer to a technical question is more easily
discovered using a Google query. Having good search tools indexing the
documentation makes it more useful. Having documentation that Google
can index effectively, is even better. 

However you provide search, the more important aspect of making
documentation user-friendly revolves around making sure that the
documentation is useful for people who *enter* using search
tools. This means linking and cross-referencing redundantly, assuming
that users will not always read the previous section, and spending
more time than you think really possible on the reference materials is
often extremely worthwhile.

If your documentation tools can produce indexes of your reference
material these kinds of information aggregations can be quite useful
for people using documentation to answer questions.

Rich Semantics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a build and presentation issue for documentation, but being
able to add some level of semantic markup to documentation almost
always helps improve clarity and reduce redundancy. In this case,
semantic markup, refers to systems that make it possible to annotate
text with tags and identifiers that make documentation easier to index
and process pragmatically. Good markup in turn makes it easy to index
and generate novel views of the documentation and of reference
material, which improves the effectiveness of search tools.

Its easy to go overboard on semantic markup and support for semantic
markup varies from system to system. The key is to make the
annotations unobtrusive for writers and readers. In the end this is
largely a documentation production issue, but better documentation
tools and processes can make documentation easier.

How to Read Documentation
-------------------------

Documentation should provide "signposts," that instruct the reader on
the internal organization and structure of the text. Notice these and
use them to navigate the documentation. If the documentation isn't
signposted, or even if it is, consider the following strategies:

- Read tables of contents and indexes.

  Tactical reading is a good strategy for finding the answer: Good
  comprehensive documentation is a marker of *great* software and
  systems, at any given moment the answers to your questions are not
  comprehensive, and having a good overview of the text can help you
  figure out how to find your answers.

  Also I think technical writers, on the whole, work really hard to
  build useful indexes of their content. So you should take advantage
  of them.

- When in doubt, use search tools to find the answer to your
  questions. Increasingly, the authors of documentation expect that
  people will use search tools to find the answers to their question,
  and this is often the most efficient means of finding the answers to
  questions.

- Scan through topical documentation and examples, but focus your
  attention on the reference materials.

  Once you have a sense of how things work and how to approach
  problems, most of the answers to your questions will be in the
  reference material anyway. These section contains information on
  particular behaviors.

How to Write Documentation
--------------------------

When you write documentation you should:

- focus on the reference materials, 

- make sure that the organization is clear and that the content is
  cross referenced, and

- make sure that you focus on being as clear and forthright as
  possible.

While it's unusual that technical writers *aren't* surprised by what
they when they write documentation, the reading experience should
contain no surprises. There are a number of less-obvious things that
you can do, as a writer, that may not be obvious.

- Use structured conventions to make reading easier.

  Lists, tables, and a restrained use of document hierarchy can make
  your texts easier to read and scan for easy reading.

- Use short clear sentences.

  Longer complex sentences take a long time to read and are hard for
  readers to parse. In some cases, complex sentences are neccessary
  for introducing complex concepts and relationships, avoid these
  kinds of sentences when possible.

- Reduce redundancy.

  Documentation should be comprehensive, but not at the expense of
  being repetitious. Include information once and then reference and
  link about to it in later sections. Redundant information is hard to
  update and makes it difficult to maintain consistent information
  across the resource.

- Within reason, whitespace increases readability.

  Readers tend to bounce between paragraphs, and if your text is full
  of 100 word paragraphs, readers will miss important details. It's
  possible to go to far, which can have a deleterious effect, but
  generally this is a good starting point.

- Always provide context and explain examples.

  Never assume that the code can or will speak for itself, or that you
  can present a code example without: 
  
  #. explaining what the effect of the sample will be,
  
  #. where it runs, and
  
  #. why it has the effect that it has.

- Clearly mark feature change notification.

  Note "version added," "deprecation," "version removed," and "version
  changed," events with related features to prevent confusion and
  frustration.

- Cross reference extensively.

  Manage documentation with software that allows you to link to other
  related or discussed topics. Cross referencing should be explicit
  and frequent, and should help users find relevant and related
  information. Cross referencing can help reduce redundancy, which in
  tern increases clarity.

Work Bottom Up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Resist the temptation to start writing documentation "from the
beginning," both in the sense of beginning to construct a technical
resource by writing the introductory material, and by fully explaining
and contextualizing processes and concepts before documenting
them. Introductory and materials are absolutely necessary for
documentation resources, but it's often better to write them when they
can introduce active content rather than when they are merely
aspirational.

Similarly, while context is absolutely essential it's easy to get
lost in providing context: too much context leads to redundancy and
documentation that's difficult to read. This is understandable. The
writers and maintainers of documentation primarily relate to the context
and explanation of the text, while users of the documentation are
primarily interested in the processes, reference material, and
examples. 

The best way to mitigate these problems is to work backwards and
construct documentation from the reference materials, procedures,
tutorials, and examples and then add a thin layer of connective text
that ties the resource together logically. There also comes a point,
somewhere in the middle of the documentation process, when it becomes
impossible to proceed without a proper introduction: write the
introduction then. Introductions are necessary when you have more than
a handful of major topics, and you need something to provide
additional structure.

Reference material can be daunting to create, not to mention boring,
but having a good reference and index makes it possible to build
documentation that's easier to maintain, and reduces overall
redundancy by centralizing core information within the
resource. Furthermore, writing documentation in a non-linear manner
tends to reduce the impulse to build larger scale narratives that make
it difficult to use and approach tactically.

.. index:: documentation; structure (inductive)

Use Inductive Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Writing education focuses on deductive forms: you introduce a premise,
provide supporting arguments and eventually arrive at a more narrow
conclusion. Technical writing, like newspaper-style journalism,
prefers an inductive style. In inductive writing, you present a
conclusion, and then present evidence and arguments to support that
conclusion as needed until you've conveyed all necessary
information. ``-30-`` Present the most important information first
with less important information following logically as needed.

While there are exceptions, approach everything inductively: from the
overall structure of a resource to the structure of individual
articles and sections to the structure of paragraphs and
sentences. These organizations make it easier for readers to discern
meaning and find the answers to the their questions. You may think of
the inductive approach as a way of "making documentation easier to
*not* read," which may be difficult to stomach if you have a
conventional writing background, but for documentation this is exactly
the right approach.

.. index:: documentation; audience

Consider Audience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The target audience for documentation defines the shape of the text
and the overall organization of the resource. Different classes of
users have different kinds of problems with technologies and
processes, ask different questions of their documentation, and have
different usage patterns based on their level of experience and
proficiency.

Good writing and considered organization leads to documentation that
is useful to multiple audiences. Indeed, proper indexing,
:term:`signposts <signpost>`, and tables of contents make
documentation more useful to more different kinds of readers by
leading them to the most relevant pieces information more quickly.

Nevertheless, different audiences need different levels of detail and
will approach their use from different perspectives. These
requirements are difficult to reconcile. The question technical
writers must ask themselves about audience is not "does this resource
contain everything that it must," but rather "does this resource
contain information that it doesn't need or that will confuse users
and make it more difficult for users to answer their questions."

You can discern part the kind of documentation that
users require based on your own experience as a user. The design of the
software or solution defines another portion of the documentation
requirements. However, the most important information
comes from the users themselves in the form of support questions, and
product inquiries.

As a result, when users ask the same question on mailing lists, in
support tickets, and on chat rooms, figure out what pieces of
information will allow users to answer their questions
themselves. Then, look at the areas of the software or solution that
people are both most interested in and least likely to intuit
independently. Use these use cases as the starting point of your
documentation, and grow outward from this base. 

Documentation needs to be user focused. Unfortunately, in most cases
users who are new to a concept or solution do not always know the
"right" questions to ask, and more experienced users won't always know
to ask the right questions that beginners need to answer. Using
secondary indications of users' needs, questions, and confusion is a
great way to ground documentation projects to ensure that the
documentation is relevant, focused, and functional.

Approach Documentation Like Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Documentation is just another user interface and another
way of solving the same "business process" issues that
scripts, software, and systems solve. Documentation requires: 

- an architecture (i.e. an outline,)

- it's iterative (i.e. revise-able,) it requires code review
  (i.e. editing,)

- it's a massive project that requires some degree of technical
  scaffolding and support (i.e. tools, frameworks, build systems,
  etc.,) and

- requires testing (i.e. quality assurance.)

If you plan, support, and organize your software and
systems/infrastructure projects, it is only reasonable to plan and
support documentation projects in the same way.

This isn't to say that you should entirely automate the authorship
process (i.e. generating documentation from unit or other tests or
from comments within the code), [#generated-documentation]_ after all
at some level people, not machines, are responsible for all code. This
isn't to say that documentation shouldn't be *tooled* and that you
shouldn't automate some aspects of the documentation process. Build
tools, indexing, and change management [#change-management]_ are great
candidates for automation.

In its "source form," documentation often resembles the software
source: both exist in a collection of plain text files, both have a
structure, and both have a build or rendering process that translates
the source into a usable product. As a result, most tools that
programmers use to manage their work and products are useful for
writing documentation, including:

- version control systems,
- automated testing frameworks,
- code review tools, 
- issue tracking databases, 
- text editors, and
- build automation tools.

The right toolkit for your project depends on many factors, and three
are a number of different approaches to documentation management that
can improve your ability to manage documentation
projects. Documentation tooling, should integrate into the systems
that you already use to manage your work on other projects. While some
projects manage documentation in the same source control repositories
as their core source code, and/or use the same issue-tracking systems
as the main projects the goal of "treating documentation like code,"
is not to strictly integrate documentation and engineering
process. Rather you should strive to reuse the tools you already have
experience with.  Consider the following cases:

- Treat issues with documentation like issues with software: file bug
  reports.

  The average problem with documentation is quite small compared to
  the average size of most issues with software. As a result the
  software that most software developers use for issue tracking tends
  to be too heavyweight for most issues. [#issue-tracking]_ However,
  users of documentation--at least for some kinds of systems and
  processes--may already be familiar with issue trackers systems,
  which makes them more ideal for providing a venue for collecting
  feedback.

  Depending on your workflow and other responsibilities it may also
  make sense to use ticketing systems as a way of managing and
  batching documentation tasks, or distributing documentation tasks
  among a team.

  When using an issue tracking system for documentation the following
  are *particularly* important for a successful experience.

  - Ensure all tickets are actionable and discrete.

    Before filing an issue on documentation: 
    
    #. ensure that you can envision a solution to your problem:
       (i.e. "document this feature or process,") or
    
    #. that you are expressing a problem with a specific aspect of the
       documentation (i.e. "I found this confusing," or "this section
       is unclear or difficult to find.")

    Documentation tickets can be pathologically open ended, with
    subjects like "improve the documentation of these related
    features" or "clarify documentation of outputs." These kins of
    issues are difficult to address and harder to figure out when
    you've actually resolved the issue.

  - Respond to all tickets in a timely way.

    Even if your publication schedule does not feasibly support
    regular updates in response to tickets, it's' important to respond
    to and triage tickets as they're filed. Providing a response to
    ensure that readers know that their feedback is valuable will pay
    off in the long run. The initial contact provides the opportunity
    to assess the issue, figure out it's severity and importance, and
    potentially readdress the un-actionable and non-atomic quality of
    the issue itself.

  - Don't be afraid to close tickets that are irrelevant.

    While there's no need to maintain a low ticket count, having too
    many unsolvable open issues makes it difficult to use the
    ticketing system to actually track ongoing improvement,
    enhancement and maintenance of the documentation.

    Often, users and engineers will attempt to add or request that you
    add information to the documentation that may actually make the
    resource less useful and more confusing for users. While all
    requests merit consideration, some requests do not merit action,
    and it's acceptable to close tickets or rewrite tickets as
    needed. 

- Track versions of documentation using source control systems.

  Version control makes the editing and publication (i.e. release)
  processes manageable. In the same way that version control systems
  make it feasible for more than one developer to work on a single
  piece of software at a time, version control allows multiple writers
  to edit and contribute to documentation at the same time.

  In the last five or ten years, version control has become more
  advanced and much easier to use, and if you produce documentation
  and expect that more than one person may *ever* work on the
  documentation, then it's good practice to use version control. Which
  version control tool you use is not especially important.

- Manage document generation and publication processes using build
  systems. (i.e. GNU Make.)

  While build automation systems (i.e. Make/GNU Make/SCons/Ant/Ninja)
  are all targeted at different use cases, and none are explicitly
  designed for building documentation, being able to reproduce the
  publication process for your documentation and thus be able to
  revise, edit, and improve the documentation on an ongoing basis is
  crucial. Furthermore, build-like processes are sufficiently regular
  and unchanging that it makes sense to record the process for in a
  script or Makefile.

- Get technical review on all changes: use code review for all [#all]_
  changes. 

  If nothing else, make sure that someone other than the original
  author reads documentation before providing it to users or
  prospective users. The review process should ensure that the
  documentation is both factually correct and stylistically clear and
  consistent. Ideally more than one person should read the
  documentation, because it's difficult to read a piece of writing for
  both style and form concurrently. However, some review is always
  better than no review.

  Make sure that you have review for all  changes to the
  documentation. While you might be able to make some small changes
  without affecting the meaning of your text, often a collection of
  incidental changes can affect the meaning or clarity of a
  document in aggregate.

.. [#generated-documentation] Generated documentation (i.e. derived
   from comments, "doc strings," or similar) is particularly lacking
   with regards to audience participation. While easy to produces and
   potentially complete, fails because the resulting documentation is
   entirely declarative, aimed at no audience, and does little more
   than summarize the code in English. While this kind of
   documentation has its utility and place, it's not useful for
   users. Any question that such documentation could answer is
   probably better addressed by reading the code.

   While engineers, product architects, and software designers often
   have all knowledge required to write documentation, their efforts
   tend to focus on functional aspects if the program, and ignore the
   practical. In most cases "how something works," is only relevant
   insofar as it affects decisions that users must make about
   deployment and configuration, and the expected behaviors of the
   product or outcomes of the process.

.. [#change-management] Because it's difficult to build documentation
   automatically, making sure that documentation changes to reflect
   the changes in the product or process is sometimes difficult.

.. [#issue-tracking] To be fair, issue tracking is far from a "solved
   problem," and issue trackers are universally despised for their
   poor design, difficult administration, and cumbersome user
   interface.

.. [#all] Well, maybe not *all* changes, but most substantive changes
   are probably worth getting some level of review.

Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every piece of information should exist in one and only
place. Furthermore, this location should be obvious, and your target
audience should be able to look at the organization of your resource
and find most pieces of information by browsing the resource and its
indexes. In most cases, users will have a different access pattern,
but keeping browsability and audience in mind when developing
organization leads to very high quality and useful resources.

In most cases, if you find that you must include a piece of
information in your documentation that seems as if it could appear in
two places, you have uncovered a more important problem. In essence
you have the following options:

- Change the structure of the resource.

  Create a new section, page, or tutorial if you need to add something
  to cover a use case or interaction path that doesn't have sufficient
  space in the existing documentation. Alternatively, you may
  sometimes merge sections sections to create a more logical
  organization that incorporates the existing information and the new
  information.

  At the same time avoid situations where reorganization result in
  needlessly deep hierarchies of section headers or
  sub-documents. While structure and hierarchy often make organization
  more apparent and easier to use, every level of hierarchy caries a
  cost: only add levels in extreme situations.

- Remove the potentially confusing piece of information. 

  When information "feels" like it fits in multiple locations, you may
  have an organization that is unclear or too expansive. Rewriting or
  deleting some of these sections can often make the "one right place"
  for the new piece of information apparent.

- Insert cross-references.

  Most documentation systems have some facility for fine-grained links
  between sections. If a note or piece of information fits in more
  than one place, consider putting that information in one place and
  inserting links from all of the other relevant places.

  Often the greatest challenge with cross referencing is ensuring that
  all of the places that need a link have it. Additionally, the cross
  refraining approach must remain consistent over time. Formal,
  recorded, policies help and prevent drift. 

- Duplicate the information.

  For small chunks of information, in some situations, duplicating
  information may be the only reasonable solution. This is a strategy
  of last resort, but with the proper cross-references, and notes to
  improve future maintenance, duplicated data sometimes leads to a
  more positive user experience.

Sometimes the information leads to an apparent and obvious
organization. In other situations the best way to resolve these
conflicts may not be clear and you may have to tolerate an non-ideal
solution. Above all, value consistency, even if you've accepted a
compromise on some point. For longer projects, have an explicitly
recorded approach for dealing with harder organizational
problems. Document maintainability is *extremely important*.

Consider the following strategies: 

- Separate the "physical" organization from the "logical" organization
  of the resource.

  Use indexing, tables of contents and file including, URL mapping
  solutions you can present users with a well organized document, that
  follows a more simple representation in the editing interface. In
  many cases, for documentation, the requirements of "physical"
  representation are much more simple than the "logical" or user
  facing organization: placing a layer of abstraction between the two
  can improve both.

  In addition this separation may be helpful providing multiple
  independent views into the same larger resource, which allows you to
  address multiple audiences and publication venues with comparatively
  minimal effort.

- Be explicit. Record the organizational decisions you make early on
  for future reference and use inline comments to include pointers to
  other parallel sections to ease the maintenance burden.

  All documentation requires some ongoing
  maintenance; however, any particular document or section is
  at best edited or reviewed once or twice a year. Having "meta"
  documentation that describes decisions that you made regarding the
  resource's organization makes this process easier and more
  consistent. At the same time, inline comments can also make it easy
  to understand "why things are the way they are," and provide helpful
  reminders of other related changes.

- Use glossaries and reference material to centralize information in
  one place and use the "content" of the resource to hold procedural
  and usage information.

  This only works well for some kinds of documentation, but it's a
  generally powerful approach. It's easy to index and search reference
  material and because reference materials don't require any narrative
  padding, it's easy for users to get answers from reference material.

  Strong and complete reference material permits procedural and usage
  documentation to omit background information because of cross
  referencing. The result is an easier to organize, easier to write,
  and easier to use documentation resource.

The Value of Documentation

Documentation is valuable as reference and standardization material
**and** because it creates value for organizations and products:

- Good documentation tends to reduce the volume of support requests
  and erroneous bug/issue reporting. Additionally, good comprehensive
  documentation makes responding to the remaining support requests
  easier.

- Good documentation gets knowledge out of people's heads and into a
  shared format. This increases reliability, because it reduces a
  dependence on people's memories and notes, which ma not always be
  accessible, or may be inconsistent.

- In absence of a specification, documentation can help define and
  regulate the user experience as development proceeds.

- Without documentation users may be unaware of features and
  behaviors, which reduces their value. If users never learn about or
  take advantage of new features and functionality, then development
  resources are essentially wasted.

This doesn't mean you should write documentation in situations where
organizing a system or environment is more practical and efficient, or
that standardizing a process with a script or program doesn't have
it's place. However, for complex problems where users interact with
your interfaces or processes, documentation is often *the
answer*. Take pride in documentation, treat it seriously, and the
return will be great.
