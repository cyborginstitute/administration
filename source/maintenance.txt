===================================================
Maintenance of *Systems Administration for Cyborgs*
===================================================

Contribution
------------

The :doc:`contents` attempts to present information regarding the
practice and strategy of systems administration that is of general
interest to developers, junior systems administrators, and other
technical audiences who are less familiar with systems
administration. While this core content and approach will remain over
time, technology changes, and administrators are always developing new
conventions and approaches to new and old problems.

In an effort to keep :doc:`contents` up to date and relevant to the
problems of the day, the author and contributors will continue to
update the text to reflect changes in practice and to remove
inaccuracies and errors as possible.

Feel free to send pull requests or patches either on `github`_ or to
the Cyborg Institute `listserv`_. If needed, you can git hosting is
available on institute servers for active contributors.

If you see an error or have an issue with any of the content in this
resource please write an email to the listserv, and one of the
existing maintainers or contributors will any required modification.

In addition to improving the quality of ":doc:`contents`" by
catching stylistic errors, improving clarity, and fact checking the

venue to disseminate tutorials, guides, and formal documentation of
